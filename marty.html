      <h3>A little bit about my self.</h3>

      <p>
        My name is Marty. I can't say that I love this name to much, but my lovely friends Lena and Ilia give me that name...
        You can see my photo on the bottom. I'm nice, isn't true?

      <h3>My goal.</h3>

      <p>
        Now I'm living with strange guy called Dima. Strange because he think that I understant what he talking about.
        But I don't! I don't speak Russian or Ukraine, only Myauulish.
        It's very beautifull cats language, but people are stupid and don't whant to learn this language.
        So... about my goal! My goal is to go to USA and now I am waiting while my f**king lovely friends
        find an appartment with f**king pets OK!!
        However, my main goal is to make nice mood for my f**king friends! ;)
